## Features and Implementation

### **Homepage**

#### **Feature Description:**

The homepage displays the user's next game information:

- **Next game details:** Date, time, and location.
- **Incoming weather:** Weather forecast near the game location.
- **Time to leave:** Calculated departure time considering travel time and traffic.
- **Gas cost:** Estimated fuel cost for traveling to the game.

#### **Steps to Implement:**

1. Fetch game details dynamically from the database (e.g., Supabase).
2. Use a weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap) to fetch and display weather data.
3. Use a geolocation API (e.g., Google Maps) to calculate travel time and suggest departure time.
4. Estimate gas cost based on distance and predefined fuel prices.

### **Stats Page**

#### **Feature Description:**

This page shows individual player statistics, including:

- **Playtime** tracked.
- **Goals**, **assists**, and **second assists**.
- **Points** (Goals + Assists).
- **Penalty minutes (PIM)**.
- Results of the **last 5 games** (final scores).
- Optionally, integrate Strava tracking for game-related activities.

#### **Steps to Implement:**

1. Fetch player stats dynamically from the database.
2. Show stats in a visually appealing format (e.g., cards or tables).
3. Use a charting library (e.g., Chart.js or Recharts) for visualizing trends in stats.
4. Add optional Strava API integration to display activity data.

### **Expenses Page**

#### **Feature Description:**

Track and display expenses related to hockey, including:

- **Gas cost** for games.
- **Game fees** or tournament costs.
- **Beer costs** for post-game beverages.
- **Equipment costs**, like sticks or gear.

#### **Steps to Implement:**

1. Create input forms for adding expenses with categories and dates.
2. Fetch expense data from the database and display totals for each category.
3. Provide a breakdown of monthly and yearly expenses.

### **Team Page**

#### **Feature Description:**

Manage details about the teams the user plays for, including:

- List of **teams** with names and colors.
- Option to **add new teams** and specify their colors (e.g., White/Black or Home/Away).

#### **Steps to Implement:**

1. Fetch the list of teams from the database.
2. Create a form for adding a new team with fields for name and colors.
3. Display teams dynamically and allow editing/deleting teams.

### **Settings Page**

#### **Feature Description:**

Configure global settings for the user:

- **Home address**: Used for travel and arena distance calculations.
- **Recurring playing day**: Set default game day(s).

#### **Steps to Implement:**

1. Fetch user settings from the database and pre-fill fields.
2. Allow users to update their home address and save it securely.
3. Add a dropdown or checkboxes for selecting recurring game days.

#### **Feature Description:**

Manage and display details about arenas where the user plays games:

- List of arenas with names and addresses.
- **Distance** from the user's home in kilometers.
- **Travel cost** calculated based on distance and fuel price.

## Project Structure

### **Backend:**

- Use Supabase for the database. Tables needed:
  - `users` (user settings and profiles).
  - `teams` (team details).
  - `games` (game schedules and results).
  - `expenses` (cost tracking).
  - `arenas` (arena details).
- APIs to fetch, update, and delete data for each page.

### **Frontend:**

- Built using React (with Vite).
- Component-based architecture for modularity and reuse.
- Custom hooks (e.g., `useUserSettings`, `useAddressAutocomplete`) for encapsulating logic.
- State management using React Context API or libraries like Zustand if necessary.

### **Styling:**

- TailwindCSS for responsive and consistent design.
- Ensure PWA compatibility for mobile-first usability.

### **Testing:**

- Unit tests for components and hooks.
- Integration tests for APIs.
- End-to-end testing for workflows like adding a new team or submitting expenses.
